# enTowerDefense

Fight off an endless horde of zombies within a small grassy arena encircled by untraversable wasteland. 
There is no crafting or repairing, and builing only consists of basic cube blocks.
All items and gear are purchase from vending machines. Zombie kills give you coins.
Build what you can during daylight, and try to survive the night!
