# enTowerDefense

Fight off an endless horde of zombies within a small grassy arena encircled by untraversable wasteland. 
There is no crafting or repairing, and builing only consists of basic cube blocks.
All items and gear are obtained by random zombie loot drops. Build what you can during daylight,
and try to survive the night!
