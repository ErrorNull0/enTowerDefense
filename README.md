# enTowerDefense

Fight off an endless horde of zombies within a small grassy arena encircled by untraversable wasteland. There is no crafting or repairing, and builing only consists of basic cube blocks. Zombie kills give you coins, and all items and gear are purchased from vending machines. Build what you can during daylight, and try to survive the night! 

REQUIREMENTS: 

Be sure to download and use the 2k-TowerDefenseMap donwloadable here - https://github.com/ErrorNull0/7D2D-Maps . Do NOT use any other mods with enTowerDefense... not even enZombies.

Turn off zombie spawning. This mod spawns zombies using its own mechanism. Also, turn off air drops.

Go into the gameevents.xml file... Modify the "enAction_GiveCoins" code. For single player set added_item_counts to 60-90 and for multiplayer set to 20-30. Modify the "enAction_GiveCoins_boss" code. For single player set added_item_counts to 300-450 and for multiplayer set to 100-150.

HOW TO PLAY:

You spawn in a small field surrounded by wasteland. Entering the wasteland will induce negative effects, so players should stay within the grassy arena. No zombies spawn at this time. A few seconds later a crate appears for each player that provides a starting weapon, blocks, bedroll, vending machine, and a red pill.

Use this time to crate a defensive structure and place down your bedrool and vending machines. Vending machines provide items and gear during the play session, which players purchase with coins that a gained from killing zombies. Harder zombies provide more coins and more points.

THE RED PILL:

When consumed, this pill begins the play session and zombies will start to spawn! It is recommended for all players to take the pill at the same time. Taking the pill also displays the HUD for each players' zombie kills and score. Green zombie face icon is the zombie kill count, and the yellow trophy is the score. You are not expected to last more than several nights. If you do, congratulations! Send me a screenshot! =)
